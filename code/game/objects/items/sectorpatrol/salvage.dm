	name = "recycler nozzle"
	desc = "A pointed, long nozzle with a trigger attached to it and a long cable dangling from the back. The cable seems like it can be plugged into something. Liquid Data shimmers with an unusual green shade in a container attached to the top of the device."
	desc_lore = "<p>On their own, these nozzles seem to be modified paint guns with an LD container on top, but jury rigged to work in reverse and aided by a small air cylinder near the trigger. This necessitates 'reloads' of the device, facilitated via plugging them into stationary charging machines. Once synced to a recycler collector unit, this device uses Liquid Data to create a localized Twilight Paradox field, which it then uses to break down any item into its very basic matter components and store this matter in a compartment on the collector.</p><p> While matter collected this way can only be effectively utilized by the Outer Veil Primary Supply Terminal which comes with its own slew of complications and restrictions, on paper at least widespread use of this technology could potentially help improve the quality of life of spacers everywhere by mercifully retiring some ships, particularly ones that still have elements of hulls from almost a century ago.</p>"
